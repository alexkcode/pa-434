# Missing Values

###########################

# 1. Use the is.na functions to calculate how many missing values in the 
# refugees, population, and migrant columns.

apply(is.na(migrant_0)[, c("Refugees", "Pop", "Migrants")],
      MARGIN = 2,
      FUN = sum)

# Refugees Pop Migrants 
# 366        0       15 
  
# 2. For the column(s) with missing values, conduct some additional analysis - 
# are those random by region, you think of an explanation of why there are 
# these missing values? Would you classify these missing values as MCAR, MAR, or MNAR?

refugees_by_year <- 
  migrant_0 %>% 
  mutate(Refugees_missing = case_when(is.na(Refugees) ~ 1, TRUE ~ 0)) %>% 
  group_by(Country, region, year) %>%

refugees_by_year %>%

  arrange(desc(missing))
  
# region              missing
# <chr>                 <dbl>
# 1 Territories/Others      156
# 2 Africa                   54
# 3 Latam                    48
# 4 Asia                     42
# 5 Oceania                  42
# 6 Developed countries      24

# Territories and Africa seem to have the most missing data. The countries in these
# regions may not have the administrative infratstructure to collect such data
# so it's likely that this missing data is at least randomly missing, or MAR. 
# Since the data is either missing for all of the years or none of them, it seems 
# hard to tell if it is more systematic than that.

migrant_0 %>% 
  mutate(Migrants_missing = case_when(is.na(Migrants) ~ 1, TRUE ~ 0)) %>% 
  group_by(Country, region, year) %>% 
  summarise(missing = sum(Migrants_missing)) %>% 
  filter(missing > 0)

# In the case of the migrant counts, the countries that lack data lack it specifically
# in the years leading up to and including 2005, so this could be due to infrastructural
# issues again or domestic issues. 
# In Montenegro's case, it wasn't even an independent country until 2006. Similarly,
# South Sudan was not independent until 2011. So this category is definitively MNAR.

# 3. Write a short wrap-up of what you discovered on missing values. 
# Note any surprising findings and you think missing values might affect any 
# analysis contacted with the dataset.

# Some missing values seem to reflect real world events, like with missing migrant
# counts, while others seem more random, like with refugee data. 
# What surprised me with the missing values was that the Refugee data would be 
# missing all of the data for a country or none at all, instead of some random 
# years being missing.
