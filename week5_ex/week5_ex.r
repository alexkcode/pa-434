# 6. Has there been any changes in the immigration patterns by gender over time? 
# Which country has the lowest female immigration?

# Consider the average across all the years.

# Missing Values
#
###########################

# 1. Use the is.na functions to calculate how many missing values in the 
# refugees, population, and migrant columns.

  
# 2. For the column(s) with missing values, conduct some additional analysis - 
# are those random by region, you think of an explanation of why there are 
# these missing values? Would you classify these missing values as MCAR, MAR, or MNAR?

  
# 3. Write a short wrap-up of what you discovered on missing values. 
# Note any surprising findings and you think missing values might affect any 
# analysis contacted with the dataset.
