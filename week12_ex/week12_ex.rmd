# Part 1

1. Extract the following states: Arizona, California, Illinois, Oregon
```{r}
str_extract(state.name, "Arizona|California|Illinois|Oregon")
```

2. Extract all states that begin with the letter a. Use both str_subset() and str_extract() to see how
the syntax differs. In both cases, extract the full name of all the states.
```{r}
str_subset(state.name, "^[Aa]")
```
```{r}
str_extract(state.name, "^[Aa].*")
```
